# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon on Stroop Effect

July 2017, by Jude Moon

## Background Information

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color='red'>RED</font>, <font color='blue'>BLUE</font>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color='green'>PURPLE</font>, <font color='purple'>ORANGE</font>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

## Task Overview

In this project, I investigated the Stroop Effect. I created hypotheses regarding the outcome of the task, and computed statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted the results in terms of the hypotheses.
